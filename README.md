   ## :earth_americas:*Trump Earth Defense*  
   A Dockerized space shooter to make Earth great again! Just "docker-compose up --build" installs NodeJS server on the server container and a React front end on the client container. It uses an official MongoDB image for saving high scores and initials. Full plug and play Xbox 360/One controller support. Trump is invading the Earth and you and your starship are the last line of defense! Move your starship up and down and fire your laser at the Trump heads when it has full charge. Each head destroyed adds to your special meter and score but one miss empties your special meter completely! When special meter is full firing your laser will fire the special missile, clearing the screen of Trump heads and awarding bonus points. If three heads break through the Earth Defense Shield then the game is over. You may then enter your initials, view the High Scores Table, and hear a special message from the President. 
```javascript
function makeGreatAgain(Earth) {
   switch (true) {
      case 'Earth is already great':
         return;
      case 'Earth is not great':
         return 'Earth is great again!!!';
   }
};
```
